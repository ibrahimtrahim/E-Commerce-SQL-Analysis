## Business Problem:
The e-commerce company is experiencing **slower sales growth** and **mixed customer satisfaction**.
Management wants to understand:
1. Which **product categories** bring the most revenue.
2. Who their **best customers** are and how loyalty impacts spending.
3. Whether **delivery performance** affects customer satisfaction.
4. How **customer reviews** and **ratings** influence product sales.
5. Which **payment methods** and **cities** are most profitable.

By answering these questions with SQL, the company can:
- Focus marketing on high-value customers.
- Improve stock management for popular products.
- Increase delivery success rate.
- Use customer feedback to improve product quality.

## Database Exploration
During this phase, I explored the database structure and content to understand the data before analysis.
I used SQL queries to check tables, counts, averages, and missing values.
You can view all queries in the [exploration.sql](exploration.sql) 
 file.
